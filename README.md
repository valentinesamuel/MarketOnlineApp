## Getting Started

This project is actually my first complete flutter application where i download a complete ui kit and tried to rebuild it the way it is with flutter.

Download the same ui kit from:

	This app is a food ordering app where users can login and order their foodd while it gets delivered to them.For now, i am only focusing on buioldthe UI with code and maybe later i will focus in the backend..For now, i practice development with the flutter framework and just wnat to focus on writing code and make sure the UI and page routing are working well..
